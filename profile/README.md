# 🙋‍♀️ We are Sakata-Mori Lab
We started in 2009, and our research lab, now in its 14th year of operation, combines insights into economics and society with advanced analytical methods. Our goal is to pioneer new frontiers in the field of technology management and become one of the world's top teams. In terms of analytical methods, we focus primarily on data science techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, network analysis, and natural language processing, which are also expected to be valuable in the field of technology management. Additionally, we emphasize fundamental research related to these methods.
