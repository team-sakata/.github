# 🙋‍♀️ We are Sakata-Mori-Asatani Lab
We started in 2009, and our research lab, now in its 14th year of operation, combines insights into economics and society with advanced analytical methods. Our goal is to pioneer new frontiers in the field of technology management and become one of the world's top teams. In terms of analytical methods, we focus primarily on data science techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, network analysis, and natural language processing, which are also expected to be valuable in the field of technology management. Additionally, we emphasize fundamental research related to these methods.

## splint-projects ("Splints")
If you are interested in conducting any projects with one or more lab members, use [this template](https://github.com/team-sakata/TMPL-splint-project)

研究室のメンバー１人以上と（つまりあなたも含めた2人以上のチームで行うということです）何か自分の研究に関連した、あるいは自分の研究以外のことがやりたい時にはスプリントプロジェクトになります。[こちらのテンプレート](https://github.com/team-sakata/TMPL-splint-project)を活用してください。

Splints include but not confined to: 

スプリントプロジェクトには例えば以下のようなものがあります：
- Readings (名著輪読)：厚くて、むずくて手がでない書籍や論文を複数人で分担して読み解きましょう。
- HandsOn (ハンズオン)：気になるライブラリ、ソフトウェア、データセットを使ってみる会を開催します。
- LabEnvironment (ラボ環境改善プロジェクト)：研究の生産性に直結する研究室の環境改善のアイデアを提示しましょう。

# 🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
We're excited that you're considering contributing to our work. This project thrives because of the energy and dedication of our contributors. Before jumping in, let's go over some guidelines that will ensure a smooth and productive collaboration.

1. **Be Respectful**: We prioritize creating an open and inclusive environment for everyone. Therefore, we enforce a policy of absolute respect. Rudeness, offensive comments, or any form of harassment will not be tolerated. Always keep the discussion focused on the task at hand, and remember that everyone is here to learn and grow.

2. **Communication**: Clear communication is key. If you're uncertain about anything, don't hesitate to ask. When discussing issues or providing feedback, be constructive and provide as much context and detail as possible. It's okay to have disagreements, but always ensure they are about the ideas, not the people.

3. **Start Small**: If you're new to the project, it's a good idea to start with smaller tasks. There are always "good first issues" labelled in our issue tracker, perfect for getting your feet wet.

4. **Stay Focused**: Keep your contributions focused on resolving the issue at hand. If you find a new issue during your work, it's usually best to file a new issue report rather than expanding the scope of your current work.

5. **Make Clean, Single-Purpose Commits**: Make sure each commit you send represents a single change that achieves a single purpose. This makes it easier for others to review your changes.

6. **Concise Pull Request**: Once you're ready to share your changes, create a [_pull request_](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). In your pull request description, explain what the changes do and attach references if possible. If your pull request fixes an existing issue, be sure to mention it.

Remember, everyone you're working with is a volunteer! Patience and kindness go a long way. We're all here to learn, grow, and help where we can. Thank you for becoming a part of our community!
